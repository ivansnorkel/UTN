        <h2><a href="#pic">Displaying tables using <strong><span>console.table()</span></strong></a> </h2>
        <p>This is one of my favorite methods because I often find that I need to take the output of code, copy and paste it into an editor, and then spend some time formatting it to make it readable before I can understand what's happening. The amazing thing about the console is that you can create tables directly in the console using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/table_static"><span>console.table()</span></a>. This makes perfect sense because usually you're running the code in the browser, and browsers can handle rendering tables pretty well already:</p>
